# PHBS_ASP_Project
This repository contains test results for the codes I contributed to the package [PyFENG](https://github.com/PyFE/PyFENG). The class [Jsu](https://github.com/PyFE/PyFENG/blob/asp-v1/pyfeng/Jsu.py) is the implementation for the Johnson's SU distribution approximation for Basket/Asian options. For detailed information, see [here](./Test_Jsu.ipynb).
